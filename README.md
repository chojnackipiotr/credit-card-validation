## Project Versions
##### v 1.0.0
- basic version with all necessary logic and styling,
- minor bugs in case of styling,
- I decided to upload this as v 1.0.0 because of other bigger project in my plans. After making it happen I will back here and start work on upgrading it.
- TODO in v 1.1.0: 
    - split code into modules
    - split css into propper files
    - rename classes
    - add extra logic and animations
    
- LESSONS LEARNT DURING THIS PHASE:
    - Plan everything even project so small. Planning will save your time.    
    - Take care of one element at one time. Don't jump between problems.
    - Once again - plan everything.
    - KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
    - Thnik before you code. Sometimes what you want to write is so dumb. Take 5 and back to work.
